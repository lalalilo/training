If there is an error in the job, we should be able to find logs in Datadog (cf `executeJob` function).\nThings I noticed:\n• We have a behaviour between environments: we received alerts in August (when the job is supposed to run) for EU prod and US staging but we received alerts in September for EU staging and US prod! It’s not obvious what the difference is between these two sets of environments.\n    ◦ The `lastTransitionTime`  and `lastProbeTime` of EU staging and US prod k8s jobs is set in September. It’s in August for the other two environments. Not sure what that means, but it’s probably linked to the issue of the alert ringing late.\n• We can’t find logs in Datadog due to the fact that they are kept during 2 weeks only.\n• There are some `audio_file_student`  rows with a `created_at`  in 2022 which confirms that the job didn’t complete.",

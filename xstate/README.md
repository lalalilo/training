## TODO

### Timer

- Start by designing states and transitions for a timer
  - add more time
  - launch timer
  - pause it
  - reset it
- Instanciate your machine, activate buttons when they should, etc
- Handle the time passing, you'll probably will have to look at actors

### Transform your timer in a pomodoro app

You can define duration of work session, as well as long and short pauses duration

### Bonus

If you have time try loading and executing a sound file to execute at the end of a step
